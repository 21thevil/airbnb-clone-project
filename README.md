# airbnb-clone-project

The primary aim of this project is to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb, allowing users to:
• 	Browse and search for rental listings based on location, price, and amenities
• 	View detailed property pages with images, descriptions, and availability
• 	Book stays with secure payment integration
• 	Enable hosts to list properties, manage bookings, and communicate with guests

Secondary goals may include:
• 	Implementing user authentication and role-based access (guest vs. host)
• 	Integrating reviews and ratings
• 	Supporting real-time availability and calendar syncing
